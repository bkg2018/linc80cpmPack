LBREXT.COM is used to extract member files from libraries (*.LBR).  Type it
alone for a help screen that shows its usage.  "LBREXT LBRNAME DU:*.* /U" will
extract and uncompress (because of option '/U') all member files, placing the
resulting files in user area 'U' of drive 'D'.

If you have an individual crunched file (indicated by a 'Z' as the middle
character of the file type), you can uncrunch it using the utility
UNCRUNCH.COM.  Type UNCRUNCH alone for a usage message.
